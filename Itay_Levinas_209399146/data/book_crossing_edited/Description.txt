The edited version of the dataset contains:

Users file: 
The users that appear here are only the users that mentioned their age and that it's between 2 and 100. 
The file is a .csv file of user-IDs and ages.

Books file: 
Several books were removed because they didn't match the format I used (author name encoding or things as such).
The books' file is a .csv file where each row has a book's ISBN, its author and its year of publication.

Ratings file:
This file is a .csv file with rows [User-ID, ISBN, Book-Rating] only for the filtered users and books and only for
explicit ratings (i.e. no zeros, on;y 1-10).
Another filtering was taking only the users that have rated more than 0.00005 of the books, so the data won't be too sparse.
Contains 3,565 users, providing 132,021 ratings about 75,711 books (density of 0.0004).
